# The Maze Puzzle 🧩

---

## 🗺️ Objective
Navigate from the **Start** tile to the **End** tile on a hidden path within a 10x10 grid.

## ❤️ Heart System

1.  You start with **3 hearts**.
2.  Clicking a correct tile earns you a heart (max 3).
3.  Clicking a wrong tile costs you one heart.
4.  If you lose all hearts:
    * You will be given another chance to attempt the level with all 3 hearts restored.
    * A **streak** is maintained: for every 2 correct blocks clicked, 1 heart is restored. This only applies if you have 1 heart left and won't affect you if you already have 3 hearts.
5.  You need to complete all **5 levels** to get the hidden password.
